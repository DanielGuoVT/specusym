\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}



% First, introduce cache timing side-channel attacks
CPU cache is a limited but crucial storage area on modern processor chips. 
It primarily relieves the speed disparity between the rapid processors and 
the slow main memory, by buffering recently used data for faster reuse. Cache 
timing side-channel attacks~\cite{Kocher96,DhemKLMQW98} leverage the 
distinguishable cache physical symptoms, i.e., the cache visiting latency 
in various program executions, to penetrate the confidentiality of the victims. 
On exploiting the vulnerable software implementations, adversaries can extract 
the application secrets
\cite{OsvikST06,TromerOS10,GullaschBK11,CGM16}, infer the neural network 
structure~\cite{YanFT18,HuLDLXJDLSX18,HongDKLRKDD18,DudduSRB18}, or even dump 
the kernel data
\cite{HundWH13,LippSGPHFHMKGYH18,KocherGGHHLMPSY19,WeisseVMGKPSSWY18}.


% Second, explain timing sc, cache timing sc, and repair; introduce SE 
A timing side-channel generally serves as the intermediate carrier through
which private data could inadvertently disclose to observers who can 
elaborately measure the timing of certain operations. One particular instance 
is the cache timing side-channel, which leaks data by the variance of the 
cache visiting latency. State-of-the-art program repair method~\cite{WuGSW18} 
mitigates cache timing leaks by enforcing constant execution time for all 
secret relevant operations. However, this strong mitigation may still get 
compromised by the thread-level concurrency~\cite{GuoWW18} or the 
instruction-level parallelism like \textit{speculative execution}~\cite{kimuraKT1996}.


% Third, briefly explain SE and its hazard
\textit{Speculative execution}~\cite{kimuraKT1996} is a vital microarchitectural
optimization in modern processors. It primarily increases the CPU instruction 
pipeline throughput by beforehand scheduling instructions under predicted branches, 
which prevents control hazards from stalling the pipeline. Despite its importance, 
the cache side effects caused by prediction errors could engender severe detriment 
through the cache timing side-channel
\cite{KocherGGHHLMPSY19,BulckMWGKPSWYS18,WeisseVMGKPSSWY18,IslamMBKGES19}. 


% Fourth, reivew the program analysis for SE
Program analysis for speculative execution is by no means a new research domain. 
Previous efforts mainly researched safe and efficient execution
\cite{ChenLDHY04,PrabhuRV10,GuarnieriKMRS19}, worst-case execution time estimation
\cite{LiMR03,LiMR05}, concurrency bug prediction~\cite{ChenWYS09,LiELS05}, and 
Spectre vulnerability detection~\cite{GuarnieriKMRS19,OleksenkoTSF19,WangCBMR19}, 
while Wu et al.~\cite{WuW19} recently proposed static verification of timing-leakage-free 
property under speculative execution. However, such an abstract interpretation based 
method~\cite{WuW19} qualitatively answers the \textit{yes} or \textit{no} question 
--- it is incapable of generating input and speculative flows to diagnose leaks in 
depth. Moreover, the over-approximation nature inevitably leads to false positives, 
which desires a more precise method.



\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \scalebox{1.0}{\input{fig_flow.tex}}
  \caption{Overall flow of \textsc{SpecuSym}.}
  \label{fig:overall_flow}
\end{figure}



% Fifth, introduce our method 
To this end, we propose a new method speculative symbolic execution 
(\textsc{SpecuSym}), for detecting cache timing leaks caused by speculative 
execution. Figure~\ref{fig:overall_flow} displays the overall flow of 
\textsc{SpecuSym}. Given a program $\prog$, which is timing-leakage-free in 
non-speculative execution, the sensitive input presented in symbol, and the 
insensitive input, \textsc{SpecuSym} leverages symbolic execution to explore 
$\prog$'s state space systematically. Meanwhile, it models speculative execution 
at conditional branches (cf. \circled{1}) and accumulates cache side effects
along with subsequent executions (cf. \circled{2}). Based on a cache model, 
\textsc{SpecuSym} constructs leak predicates for memory visits and conducts a 
constraint-solving based cache behavior analysis (cf. \circled{3}) to generate 
the leak witnesses (cf. \circled{4}). 


% Sixth, point out the challenges 
Our new method has three significant challenges. The first challenge comes from 
the modeling of speculative behaviors. Classic symbolic executors
\cite{CadarDE08,PasareanuR10} 
neither support speculative execution nor are cache-aware since they primarily 
concentrate on the functional correctness rather than reasoning the implicit 
program properties. 
%
The second challenge derives from the cache state maintenance. Due to the symbolic 
nature, a symbolic memory address may correspond to multiple concrete addresses. 
Updating the cache status after each memory operation unquestionably leads to an 
explosive number of different cache states. 
%
The last challenge stems from the analysis cost. Processors may trigger multiple 
branch mispredictions during a program execution. Indiscriminately covering all 
possibilities introduces not only tremendous constraint solving overhead but also 
counts many redundant cases. 


To overcome the first challenge, we design a new modeling algorithm in symbolic 
execution which satisfies both feasibility and high-fidelity. In essence, it 
utilizes the stateful exploration to mimic the speculative behaviors and isolates 
memory changes in auxiliary states from the standard symbolic states. 
%
To tackle the second challenge, we develop a lazy modeling strategy that tracks 
memory accesses and lazily reasons about cache effects rather than maintaining a 
complete set of cache states on-the-fly. 
%
To address the last challenge, we filter the branches that are unlikely to cause 
harmful speculative execution. Also, we develop several optimizations to shrink 
the constraint size for solving cost reduction.



\ignore{
Also, We develop a merging schema between the mimicked states and regular symbolic 
states to accumulate the cache side effects.

In general, we decompose the precise but lengthy constraint into smaller chunks 
without losing correctness, as well as utilizing executor kernel characteristics 
for faster computation.

However, the side effects caused by speculative execution are normally undetectable 
under standard symbolic execution. To overcome this problem, we introduce the 
$\mathit{speculative~modeling}$ into symbolic execution. Thus, cache side effects 
are visible and cache timing leaks from speculative execution detectable now. 
}


We have implemented \SpecuSym atop KLEE~\cite{CadarDE08} and LLVM~\cite{LattnerA04} 
and evaluated it on 15 benchmarks, which have 8,791 lines of C code in total. Results 
show that \SpecuSym successfully detects from 2 to 61 leaks in 6 programs under 4 
set-associative caches and identifies false positives in 2 programs reported by recent 
work. To summarize, we have made the following contributions:

\begin{compactitem}
  \item 
    A novel approach for modeling microarchitectural speculative execution and 
		analyzing the affected cache behaviors in symbolic execution.
  \item 
		Implementation of \textsc{SpecuSym}, which addresses the challenges mentioned
		above and supports cache timing leak detection under speculative execution. 
  \item 
    Evaluation of \SpecuSym on 15 open-source benchmarks to demonstrate its 
    effectiveness through discovering from 2 to 61 leaks upon 4 different 
		cache settings.
\end{compactitem}




The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section~\ref{sec:mtv} 
motivates our work, and Section~\ref{sec:prelim} reviews the background 
knowledge. Section~\ref{sec:specuSE} states the major contributions and
optimization. Then we conduct experiments in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} 
and discuss the related work in Section~\ref{sec:related}. Finally, we 
conclude our work in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.




\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:mtv}

This section uses an example to explain the motivation. By studying its 
leakage-free cache behavior under non-speculative execution and the new 
leaks caused by speculative execution, we position how \SpecuSym should
facility leak diagnosis.


\subsection{Program ${\prog}$ and the Cache Mapping}
\label{sec:leak_example}

Figure~\ref{fig:fig2-a} shows a program snippet ${\prog}$ whose execution 
time remains stationary in non-speculative execution but varies in terms
of the sensitive input when running under speculative execution.


Listed at line 2, ${\prog}$ has 4 local variables as \texttt{S}, \texttt{x}, 
\texttt{v1}, and \texttt{v2}. Operating these variables leads to memory 
access. E.g., the implicit memory read of \texttt{x} (line 6) and the 
explicit \emph{store} to \texttt{v1} (line 7). The remaining variable 
\texttt{i} (line 3) is a register variable that incurs no memory access. 
Also, variable \texttt{x} is the sensitive input, and any form of revealing 
its value turns to be a leak. 


We leverage a fully associative cache $\mathcal{C}$ for the analysis purpose 
of $\prog$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:2b}. It is an extreme case of the 
N-way associative cache where the memory address of a variable in $\prog$ may 
map to any cache line of $\mathcal{C}$, subjecting to the line availability 
and the replacement policy. Here we assume $\mathcal{C}$ adopts the \emph{Least
Recently Used} (LRU) policy, which always evicts the least used line once 
$\mathcal{C}$ has been entirely occupied.


Cache $\mathcal{C}$ consists of 256 cache lines, and each line has exactly 
1-byte size. Local variables are mapped to $\mathcal{C}$ according to the 
program execution order and their sizes. E.g., in Figure~\ref{fig:2b} array 
\texttt{S} maps from cache lines \#1 to \#254 because of the array traverse 
in the \emph{while} loop (lines 4-5), and each 1-byte array item successively 
occupies a full cache line. Then variable \texttt{x} associates with line 
\#255. Next, \texttt{v1} fills the last available line (line \#256) if 
\texttt{x}$>$\texttt{128} satisfies; thus, the execution proceeds into the 
\textit{if} flow. Otherwise, the execution takes the \textit{else} branch 
and writes \texttt{v2}, mapping \texttt{v2} to line $\#256$.

\subsection{Leakage-free in Non-speculative Execution}
\label{sec:no_leak}

Running $\prog$ without speculative execution won't leak any information 
about \texttt{x}. This section analyzes the cache behavior in details. 


There are two program paths in $\prog$ because of the \textit{if-else} 
branch. Let's name the one containing the \textit{if} branch as $p_1$ 
and the other one as $p_2$. The only difference between $p_1$ and $p_2$
is the \emph{store} operation, which writes \texttt{v1} on $p_1$ but 
\texttt{v2} on $p_2$. As analyzed in Section~\ref{sec:leak_example}, 
\texttt{v1} would map to the last line of cache $\mathcal{C}$. Similarly, 
without speculative execution, \texttt{v2} also maps to the same line, as 
annotated by the solid arrow in Figure~\ref{fig:2b}. This overlapping 
situation is because usually either $p_1$ or $p_2$ could be taken; 
hence either the \textit{store} to \texttt{v1} or the \textit{store} 
to \texttt{v2} may happen. In both cases, line \#256 is empty before 
the \textit{store} operations. Thereby, \texttt{v1} or \texttt{v2} 
uses this available line.


In view of this fact, we can observe similar cache behaviors on both $p_1$ 
and $p_2$ under non-speculative execution. The first 254 \emph{load} 
operations on array \texttt{S}, the next implicit memory read of \texttt{x},
and the succedent \textit{store} to \texttt{v1} on $p_1$ or to \texttt{v2} 
on $p_2$ all cause cold misses since cache $\mathcal{C}$ is initially empty. 
Likewise, the last memory \emph{load} on \texttt{S[x]} (line 10) must be a 
cache hit on both paths because \texttt{S} and \texttt{x} have already been 
in cache $\mathcal{C}$. In other words, $\prog$'s cache behavior is 
independent of the sensitive input \texttt{x}. As a result, $\prog$ has no 
cache timing leaks under non-speculative execution.


\subsection{New Leak under Speculative Execution}
\label{sec:specu_leak}

In Section~\ref{sec:no_leak}, only one \textit{store} operation can happen 
in non-speculative execution. However, the situation changes, and a new timing 
leak appears when taking speculative execution into account.  


Under speculative execution, the instructions guarded by a branch \emph{br} can 
be scheduled before the execution proceeds into \emph{br} in case CPU predicts 
that \emph{br} is likely to be taken. For example, suppose we first run $\prog$ 
with \texttt{x}$\in$[128,255] several times and flush the cache after each run. 
Afterward, we rerun $\prog$ but setting \texttt{x} to 127. Still, the 
\textit{store} instruction under the \emph{if} branch (line 7) would be executed 
before $\prog$ steers into the \emph{else} branch due to the branch misprediction. 
More importantly, though the CPU performs a rollback to discard the value update 
to \texttt{v1}, \texttt{v1} remains in $\mathcal{C}$ even after the remedy. 


Going until line 9, array \texttt{S} and variable \texttt{x} map from lines \#1 
to \#255 and \texttt{v1} still occupies line \#256. At this point, there is no 
empty line available for \texttt{v2}. Following the LRU policy declared in Sction
\ref{sec:leak_example}, executing the \textit{store} instruction at line 9 would 
evict the oldest item \texttt{S[0]} from cache $\mathcal{C}$ and map \texttt{v2} 
to the vacated line \#1, as shown by the dotted arrow in Figure~\ref{fig:2b}.


After that, the program execution continues to line 10, reaching the last memory 
\textit{load} of \texttt{S[x]}. Sensitive input \texttt{x} now determines which 
array cell would be visited. And we examine the cache behavior of this \textit{load} 
in terms of two cases \texttt{x=0} and \texttt{x$\neq$0}.


\begin{itemize*}
  \item \texttt{x=0}: $\prog$ reads array cell \texttt{S[0]}. Recall that \texttt{x} 
	is still in cache $\mathcal{C}$, but \texttt{S[0]} is no longer in $\mathcal{C}$ 
	due to the replacement by \texttt{v2}. So this memory \textit{load}	causes a 
	conflicting cache miss.
  \item \texttt{x$\neq$0}: Since the whole array \texttt{S} except \texttt{S[0]}
    is in $\mathcal{C}$, the \textit{load} of \texttt{S[x]} must get a cache hit 
		no matter what value \texttt{x} is.
\end{itemize*}


Only if \texttt{x=0} there appears one more cache miss on path $p_2$. It is a 
unique situation that enables attackers to learn the value of \texttt{x} due to 
a measurable longer execution time. Note that the cold miss from speculatively 
writing \texttt{v1} also causes an internal latency. However, it is un-observable 
to the external users, and we ignore it safely for analysis purposes.


\subsection{What \SpecuSym Should Provide}
\label{sec:app-scenarios}

The example shows that, though a program is carefully crafted to avoid cache 
timing leaks, running it under speculative execution may still exhibit new 
leaks. Since speculative execution is one of the fundamental optimizations 
in modern processors, a systematic analysis that exposes the subtle leaks 
would be of utmost importance. Specifically, we focus on two abilities in 
our new method.


First, \SpecuSym should be able to systematically explore the program state 
space to identify execution paths and speculative flows that may cause leaks. 
E.g., $\mathit{p_2}$ and the speculative execution of the \textit{if} branch. 
Note that speculation of the \textit{else} branch won't cause a similar 
leak along with $\mathit{p_1}$.


Second, \SpecuSym should be able to pinpoint the leak sites by a precise cache 
analysis and generate concrete inputs that witness new cache behavior at the 
identified memory visit sites. E.g., the memory \textit{store} instructions to 
\texttt{v2} and the value \textit{zero} of \texttt{x}.


\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:prelim}

This section reviews the preliminary knowledge of symbolic execution, cache timing leak, 
and speculative execution.


%\newpage\clearpage
\subsection{Symbolic Execution}
\label{sec:se}




Symbolic execution, as a systematic program testing and analysis technique, 
was first introduced in the 1970s~\cite{King76,Clarke76}. In this work, we 
assume that a program $\prog$ consists of a finite set of instructions, and 
$\prog$ defines execution semantics in program paths. Let \textit{inst} be 
an instruction, then interpreting an event $e$:=$(l_b\succ inst\succ l_a)$ 
in symbolic execution stands for the execution of \textit{inst} where $l_b$ 
and $l_a$ denote the locations before and after $inst$, respectively. A 
program execution explores a sequence of events along the program path. 
Close to~\cite{GuoKWYG15,GuoWW18}, we abstract a symbolic event $e$ into 
three categories in terms of the type of \textit{inst} that $e$ contains.


\begin{itemize*}
  \item $\psi$-event, which presents a branch instruction. It models the 
    \textit{then} branch by \textcode{assume$(c)$} and the \textit{else} 
    branch by \textcode{assume$(\neg c)$}, respectively. Term $\textit{c}$ 
    is the representative of a conditional predicate expressed in symbolic 
    expression. 

  \item $\chi$-event, which corresponds to a memory \textit{read} instruction 
    of the form $\textit{var}=\textit{load~addr}$, or a memory \textit{write} 
    instruction like $\textit{store~addr, expr}$ where \textit{addr} is the 
    memory address, and \textit{expr} is a symbolic expression.

  \item $\varphi$-event, which represents other types of instructions in the 
    form $\textit{var}:=\textit{expr}$. Here \textit{var} is a variable, and 
    \textit{expr} is a symbolic expression computed from preceding operations 
    like arithmetic calculation, bit manipulation, etc.
\end{itemize*}


Although symbolic executors always support a rich set of instructions, we use 
the above event types to abstract away the internal implementation details like 
memory allocation, function return, etc.to center on the high-level flow of 
symbolic execution.

}
\end{algorithm}


Algorithm~\ref{alg:baseline} presents the baseline 
symbolic execution of a program with sensitive input. Unlike prior works
\cite{GuoKWYG15,GuoWW18}, both global and local memory accesses are uniformly
handled. The data input, $\mathit{in}:=\{\lambda,t\}$, determines a program 
execution path consisting of ordered events $\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$ where 
$\mathit{\lambda}$ is the sensitive input, e.g., privacy data or cipher keys, 
and $\mathit{t}$ is the insensitive input.


The \textsc{Stack} is a global container for storing symbolic states during 
dynamic exploration. A symbolic state $\mathit{s}$ exhibits the frontier of 
a path execution. We define $\mathit{s}$ as a tuple $\langle \pcon, \mathit{e},
\mathit{brs}, \Omega \rangle$. $\pcon$ denotes the path condition that leads 
to $\mathit{s}$ where $\mathit{e}$ is the event to execute at $\mathit{s}$. 
$\mathit{brs}$ contains the set of branch predicates if $\mathit{e}$ is a 
$\psi$ event. And $\Omega$ is the symbolic memory which maintains the mappings 
from the program variables to their memory values at $\mathit{s}$.


Initially, the state container \textsc{Stack} is empty, and we start the main 
procedure \SymExec with the initial state $\mathit{s_{ini}}$ on input $\mathit{in}$.
During the recursive execution, \SymExec may split a branch (lines 4-8), perform 
a memory operation (lines 9-10), conduct an internal computation (lines 11-12), 
or terminate a state (line 14), depending on the type of the event to execute.


Note that at the entry of each recursion, \SymExec takes a new symbolic state 
as the input, which is obtained from invoking a secondary procedure 
\textit{SubsequentState}. This procedure accepts the current state 
\textit{s} as the input and outputs a new state $s'$ by symbolically executing 
the \textit{inst} in \textit{s.e}. For brevity, we omit the details of the 
instruction interpretation, which can be found in~\cite{CadarDE08,PasareanuR10}.



\subsection{Cache Timing Leak}
\label{sec:leak}

Memory operations are prone to timing leaks because of the outstanding accessing 
latency between the cache and the main memory. For example, reading data from the 
cache may cost 1-3 processor cycles, whereas loading data from memory could spend 
hundreds of cycles. In this section, we first establish the threat model and then 
formalize the leak definition based on the threat model.


\subsubsection{The Threat Model}
\label{sec:threat}

As exhibited in Section~\ref{sec:specu_leak}, sensitive data involved in memory 
access may get leaked from the timing traffic of a memory write. To capture such 
kind of subtle leak in our analysis, we assume the attackers can perform strong 
external threats. 


First, we assume the attackers share the same processor with the victim process. 
Hence they can learn the shared cache states by probe methods. Second, they are 
allowed to request the execution of the victim process. Third, they can observe 
the latency of the interested memory visits in the victim process. Our threat 
model is close to those used in practical attacks like
\cite{OsvikST06,YaromF14,DisselkoenKPT17}, where the attackers can deduce the 
cache block states by measuring the timing traffic of either the victim or the 
attacker process. Moreover, this model also appears in leak detection techniques 
like~\cite{WangWLZW17,DoychevK17,WichelmannMES18,BrotzmanLZTK2018}. Therefore, 
we believe it is a reasonable model for analysis purposes.
%without strong acquisition of system priviledges.


\subsubsection{The Leak Definition}

Formally, we abstract a sensitive data related program $\prog$ to be a function 
$\mathit{F_{\prog}(in)\Rightarrow out}$. $\mathit{F_{\prog}}$ processes the data 
input $\mathit{in}:=\{\lambda,t\}$ (cf. Section~\ref{sec:se}) and returns the 
output $\mathit{out}$. E.g., assuming $\prog$ is an encryption process, $\lambda$ 
is the private key, and $t$ is the content to encrypt; then, $out$ is the ciphertext. 
Let $T(F_{\prog}(in))$ denotes the execution time of $\prog$ with input $\mathit{in}$ 
under non-speculative execution. Different inputs may explore various program paths. 
However, since we aim at timing leaks introduced by speculative execution, here we 
assume the time of those non-speculative program executions remain similar or the 
same, no matter what the sensitive inputs are, which is, 
%
\begin{multline} 
  \label{lb:no_leak_event}
  ~~~~~\mathit{\forall t,\lambda,\lambda'~.~T(F_{\prog}(\lambda,t)) \simeq 
  T(F_{\prog}(\lambda',t))}~~~~
\end{multline} 
%
Symbols $\lambda$ and $\lambda'$ denote any two sensitive inputs, and $t$ is still 
the public input. Nevertheless, since in practice, attackers may gain information 
by observing several memory visits or cache lines, we restrict the leak granularity 
at the memory operation level regarding our threat model. Specifically, let $\mathit{e}$ 
be a memory event on executing $\prog$ and the time of interpreting $\mathit{e}$ with 
and without speculative execution be 
$\mathit{T_{s}(\prog_e(in))}$ and $\mathit{T(\prog_e(in))}$, we assume:
%
\begin{multline} 
  \label{lb:no_leak_event}
  ~~~~~\mathit{\forall t,\lambda,\lambda'~.~T(\prog_e(\lambda,t)) \simeq 
  T(\prog_e(\lambda',t))}~~~~
\end{multline} 
%
Then the existence of a new cache timing leak under speculative execution can be 
checked by the following formula: 
%
\begin{multline}
\label{lb:specu_leak}
\mathit{\exists t,\lambda,\lambda'~.~
	\big(
			\lambda \neq \lambda' \wedge T_{s}({\prog_e}(\lambda,t)) 
			\neq T_{s}({\prog_e}(\lambda',t))}
	\big)
	\vee 
	\\  
	T({\prog_e}(\lambda,t)) \neq T_{s}({\prog_e}(\lambda',t)) ~~~
\end{multline}
%
where a leak appears if (1) two different sensitive inputs can cause significant 
timing differences in executing $\mathit{e}$ under speculative execution, or (2) 
two sensitive inputs can cause significant timing difference in executing $\mathit{e}$ 
with and without speculative execution. In other words, $\prog$ leaks due to 
speculative execution if any pair of $\lambda$ and $\lambda'$ exists. Furthermore, 
we transform formula (\ref{lb:specu_leak}) into a dedicated leak constraint and 
simplify the constraint to a more concise form in Section~\ref{sec:specuSE}. Also, 
as public input plays a minor role in modeling cache timing leaks~\cite{WangBLWZW19}, 
we set insensitive input $t$ to a fixed value to reduce the reasoning cost of formula
(\ref{lb:specu_leak}). 


\ignore{
Also, we assume $\prog$ has the same set of instructions on each program path and 
speculative execution only changes the cache state. 
}



\subsection{Speculative Execution}
\label{sec:specu}


The CPU instruction pipeline~\cite{RamamoorthyL77} allows overlapped executions 
of proper instructions where each instruction execution consists of a series of 
micro-stages. This instruction-level parallelism benefits hardware utilization 
since instruction can start its stage before the time its prior instructions 
have completed all their stages. However, a pipelined processor may get stalled 
once the program control flow needs to divert, but the destination remains 
unknown (e.g., at a conditional branch). Accordingly, the pipeline has to wait 
until the flow decision gets computed.


To alleviate the cost of such control hazard, processors leverage 
\textit{speculative execution}~\cite{kimuraKT1996} and \textit{branch prediction}
\cite{Mittal19} to reduce the delay that could incur on conditional branch 
instructions. Generally, they predict the execution flow upon the history of 
recently executed branches, and schedule instructions under predicted branches
ahead of jumping into these branches. Specifically, on approaching a control 
hazard, the processors first predicts a branch to take. Then, they execute the 
instructions under the selected branch and maintain the temporary path state 
in a dedicated buffer. Finally, they commit the buffered state to continue the 
program flow if they achieved a correct prediction. Otherwise, upon an incorrect 
prediction, they have to discard the temporary state to revert the effects of the 
executed instructions hence avoiding functional errors. 


This rollback mechanism, unfortunately, withdraws no affected cache state, which 
raises security risks. As shown in Section~\ref{sec:specu_leak}, variable \texttt{v1} 
maps to cache line \#256 due to the misprediction of the \textit{if} branch; and, 
this cache effect remains unchanged, even control flow directs to the \textit{else} 
branch. As a result, sensitive data \texttt{x} leaks due to the interfered cache 
state. Abstracting away the hardware details, we can model the speculative behavior 
in symbolic execution as a three-phase analysis and evaluate its cache side effects 
with a constraint-solving based approach. 


\subsubsection{Misprediction Modeling.}
As aforementioned, on reaching a control hazard, the processors make a prediction to
select a branch for execution. Despite the experience-based hardware realization
in CPUs, we can model this behavior by an auxiliary symbolic state. To be specific, 
before diverging the control flow into the \textit{else} branch, our symbolic executor 
would decide to duplicate a new state from the current symbolic state and schedule
it immediately into the \textit{if} flow, which models the branch prediction of the 
\textit{if} branch. Similarly, we can model the misprediction of the \textit{else} 
branch on demand.


\ignore{
Note that we only model speculative execution at branches where both \textit{if} 
and \textit{else} decisions are feasible in terms of the branch conditions. The 
assumption considers the situation where the hazard is dependent on the computation 
over input and cannot be inferred as a \textit{true} or a \textit{false} value in 
advance. In contrast, if the condition is determined to be \textit{true} or 
\textit{false} at the branch point, e.g., the \textit{while} loop head in Figure
\ref{fig:fig2-a}, then the branch decision is deterministic.
}


\ignore{
However, different program inputs might go through various program paths to reach 
a same branch point but trigger divergent decisions. Thus, in practice speculative 
executions at these points do exist and our method complies with the fact.
}


\subsubsection{Speculative State Execution.}
Each duplicated state in \textit{misprediction modeling} has the same snapshot to 
its parent state. For clarity, we use \textit{speculative} state to alias this newly
forked state. A \textit{speculative} state would be prioritized to the front of the 
state container in symbolic executor, and uninterruptedly executes until it meets a 
predefined threshold, like the size of the Reorder Buffer (ROB), the pipeline stage 
number, the branch depth, etc. Also, a \textit{speculative} state runs independently 
from its parent state; thus, any memory updates in the \textit{speculative} state 
won't taint its parent state who is waiting for the \textit{speculative} state returns. 
For the sake of cache analysis, we also maintain the cache data in each symbolic state. 
A \textit{speculative} state inherits such data from the parent state and keeps updating 
the cache during its execution.


\subsubsection{Rollback and Cache Merging.}
Once the \textit{speculative} state reaches the threshold, it has to stop and exit the 
state stack. Right before the termination, it notifies the awaiting parent state the 
finish of the speculation and transfers the latest cache data back to its parent. Upon 
accepting the notification, the parent symbolic state merges the received cache information
into its cache data, to form the latest cache state. After that, the parent state aborts 
waiting and resumes the regular execution. This step models the processor rollback in 
high fidelity and retains the cache status changes from speculation. Since the cache 
changes have already merged into the parent state, terminating the \textit{speculative} 
state causes no further affects.  


Our approach is natural to symbolic execution, while state-of-the-art simulation 
method~\cite{OleksenkoTSF19} requires sophisticated instrumentations and special 
instructions to enforce CPU behaviors. More modeling details would appear in 
Section~\ref{sec:spec_modeling}.


\ignore{
Our modeling approach is sound and elegant. Focusing on the worst 
case predication, we avoid missing any speculated branch that may 
cause leaks.

\subsection{Speculative Modeling}
\label{sec:spec_modeling}

%In this section we show how \SpecuSym models branch mispredictions and
%speculative execution by introducing auxiliary symbolic states and 
%orchestrating them in proper orders.

On entering the \SpecuSym procedure in Algorithm~\ref{alg:specusym}, our new 
algorithm first checks if current state $s$ is a \textit{speculative state}
and whether $s$ has reached the predefined threshold (line 3). If both 
conditions are met, \SpecuSym stops the recursive symbolic execution on $s$ 
and returns immediately (line 4). Note that a state becomes a 
\textit{speculative} state if it is duplicated from a normal symbolic state 
(line 21) by invoking \textit{SpeculativeExplore} at a branch event (line 9). 


%At the high level, subroutine $\mathit{SpeculativeExplore}$ models 
%branch mispredictions with extra symbolic states, and updates the
%cache on exploring these auxiliary states.


Lines 19-28 in Algorithm~\ref{alg:specusym} present the modeling procedure 
\textit{SpeculativeExplore}. Generally, at a conditional branch (line 8), 
we call \textit{SpeculativeExplore} (line 9) to start the speculative probe. 
That is, if the branch predicate closely relates to memory visit (line 20), 
e.g., using a variable for the first time, we duplicate a new state $s'$ 
from current state \textit{s} (line 21) with a negated branch direction 
(line 22). This assumption bases on the observation that the memory visiting 
latency at a branch may form a time window for speculative execution to load 
data into the cache. Otherwise, despite a branch misprediction, CPU may spend 
only several cycles on speculative execution before its rollback, which is too 
transient to let speculation affect the cache.


After state duplication, new state ${s'}$ becomes a \textit{speculative} state, 
since it is about to mimic the speculation of the mispredicted branch. We let 
\SpecuSym explore $s'$ (line 23) and assess the effects of the memory accesses 
in $s'$ on the cache (line 15). Details of the assessment present in Section
\ref{sec:modeling}. Once the execution of $s'$ finishes, we use the accumulated 
cache data in $s'$ to update that of $s$ (line 24) and terminate $s'$ (line 25) 
to end its lifecycle. Such design ensures that the speculation of $s'$ only 
contributes to the cache state changes but never affects the memory $\Omega$ of 
its parent symbolic state.


Next, after $\mathit{SpeculativeExplore}$ returns, we resume the normal symbolic
execution of $s$ (line 10), who now has an updated cache. In this way, we   have 
constructed a speculative scenario and retain the latest cache changes. Our
modeling method leverages the stateful nature of symbolic execution. It not only 
models the speculative behavior but also precisely transfers the cache information 
between symbolic states with controllable flexibility. 


Figure~\ref{fig:specu_modeling} shows the speculative modeling of motivating 
program $\prog$. Figure~\ref{fig:3a} displays the control flow graph on 
which we annotate the memory access related variables. E.g., \texttt{S[0]} 
indicates the first array read in the $\mathit{while}$ loop, and \texttt{v1} 
means the memory \emph{write} in the $\mathit{if}$ branch. The solid arrow 
line denotes the execution flow of state $s$, which takes the $\mathit{else}$ 
branch in regular symbolic execution. 


In Figure~\ref{fig:3a}, on reaching the branch point, \SpecuSym duplicates a 
\textit{speculative} state $s'$ from $s$. Then, it enforces a bounded symbolic 
execution of $s'$, e.g., one memory access inside the \textit{if} branch, as 
shown by the dashed arrow curve. Once meeting the speculation threshold, 
\SpecuSym stops the exploration and turns back to find state $s$ who is awaiting 
the finish of $s'$. Also, before resuming $s$, \SpecuSym incorporate the cache 
state of $s'$ (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:3b}) into $s$ and terminate $s'$. Right now, 
the entire cache has been filled since the memory write in $s'$ mapped \texttt{v1} 
into line \#256. 


Subsequently, executing the memory \emph{store} to \texttt{v2} in state $s$ has
to evict \texttt{S[0]} from cache line \#1 following the LRU policy, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:3b}. Then, the last memory \emph{load} of \texttt{S[x]} might 
result in a cache miss or a hit, counting on the value of \texttt{x}, which is 
consistent with the situation explained in Section~\ref{sec:specu_leak}. Hence, 
\SpecuSym succeeds in modeling speculative execution and conforms to the 
three-phase analysis designed in Section~\ref{sec:specu}. Note that Figure
\ref{fig:3a} only shows the modeling of the \emph{if} branch while \SpecuSym 
considers both branches and misses no potential cases. 

%Also, we can use different bounds of the speculative state for more practical 
%cache analysis.

\ignore{
In Figure~\ref{fig:3a}, the speculative state $s'$ inherits the cache 
state from $s$, maps \texttt{v2} into a cache line, and merges back the updated 
cache state to state $s$ before its termination, as formally stated in Algorithm
\ref{alg:specusym} (lines 23-25). 
}


In this example, updating the cache state is straightforward. By checking the 
in-cache addresses to find a proper cache line upon a cache miss, or update the 
most recently used line in case of a hit. For the undecided address, i.e., 
\texttt{S[x]}, we can, at worst, try 254 possiblities to test the differences. 
However, eagerly enumerating all potentials is impractical for real-world programs 
due to the unbearable overhead. Furthermore, a great many cache mappings are
indeed redundant in terms of leak exposure. For instance, only 1 mapping can 
reveal a leak in the motivating example. 


% Abstract interpretation based analysis~\cite{WuW19} approximates concrete 
%possibilities, whereas this approach is ineffective in symbolic execution. 


Instead, \SpecuSym models branch mispredictions along with a path exploration
and maintains a trace of memory events as the alternative of the cache state. 
Then it analyzes the event trace to build the leak constraint and lazily 
searches for feasible solutions. We detail this approach in Section
\ref{sec:modeling} and Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. 

As mentioned before, speculative execution terminates when meeting a threshold such as the size of the ROB, the pipeline stage number, the branch depth, etc. Since these thresholds vary across architectures and hardware configurations, we use a single bound to represent them all and set it as configurable in our modeling. The bound restricts the maximum number of instructions that can be executed in a speculative state. When reaching the bound, the speculative state as well as those forked from it are all killed.

\subsection{Cache State Modeling}
\label{sec:modeling}

%The cache state during a program execution refers to the status of the 
%cache lines after executing every memory-related instruction, e.g., the 
%cache snapshot shown in Figure~\ref{fig:3b}.

This section addresses how \SpecuSym models the cache state. We extend the 
definition of a symbolic state $s$ (cf. Section~\ref{sec:se}) to be a new 
tuple $\langle \pcon, \mathit{e}, \mathit{brs},\Omega,\pi\rangle$. The new 
symbol $\pi$ denotes the memory event trace in $s$. Then we establish the 
following notions:
%
%
\begin{itemize*}
  \item A program state in \SpecuSym is either a normal \textit{symbolic} state 
	or a \textit{speculative} state that from the former can the latter be 
	duplicated, but not vice versa. 
  \item A memory event trace denoted as $\pi:=\mathit{\{m_0,...,m_n\}}$, 
    consists of happened memory events in the execution order.
  \item Each memory event $\mathit{m_i}$ in $\pi$, where index $i\in [0,n]$, 
	comes from either a \textit{symbolic} state or a \textit{speculative} state.
  \item $\pi$ and the correlated computations alternatively represent the cache 
	state in a program state $s$.
\end{itemize*}
%
%
\ignore{
On modeling the cache state, exsiting tools such as CaSym~\cite{BrotzmanLZTK2018} 
maintains and updates cache mappings during symbolic execution; others like 
Chalice~\cite{ChattopadhyayBRZ17} and \textsc{SymSC}~\cite{GuoWW18} uses 
offline constraint solving to to reason about the cache behaviors of memory 
accesses upon concrete cache models. To better coordinate the speculative 
modeling component, \SpecuSym adopts an on-the-fly analysis.
}

To be specific, after interpreting an event $m_i$ in a \textit{symbolic} 
state $s$, \SpecuSym analyzes if $\mathit{m_i}$ can cause timing leak 
under two scenarios, namely the new \textit{divergent} behavior and the 
new \textit{opposite} behavior. To explain these scenarios, we define 
more notions as follows.
%
%
\begin{itemize*}
  %\item [$-$]$\mathit{\mu_{in}(m_i)}$ denotes the condition satisfying which 
% \item $\mathit{\mu_{in}(m_i)}$ denotes the condition that $\mathit{m_i}$ 
%	can trigger a cache hit under speculative execution with input $\mathit{in}$. 
  \item $\mathit{a_i}$ denotes the used memory address in event $\mathit{m_i}$.
  \item $\mathit{cs(a_i)}$ denotes the cache set that address $\mathit{a_i}$ maps to.
  \item $\mathit{tag(a_i)}$ denotes the unique $\mathit{tag}$ of address $\mathit{a_i}$.
  \item {N} denotes the cache associativity where N$\in$[1, the total number of cache lines] (e.g., N-way set-associative cache). 
\end{itemize*}
%
%
\subsubsection{New Opposite Behavior}
\label{sec:new_opp}
It means executing $\mathit{m_i}$ under non-speculative execution causes an 
always-miss, while the result under speculative execution is an always-hit, 
and vice versa. Recall that we only target new leaks introduced by speculative 
execution, and this scene depicts the exact opposite situation. To build the 
formal definition, we define new notions: 
%
%
\begin{itemize*}
  \item $\mathit{\eta_{in}(m_i)}$ denotes the condition that $\mathit{m_i}$ 
	triggers an always-hit under speculative execution with input $\mathit{in}$.
  \item $\mathit{\eta^\prime_{in}(m_i)}$ denotes the condition that $\mathit{m_i}$ 
	triggers an always-hit under non-speculative execution with input $\mathit{in}$.
  \item Boolean variable $\mathit{org(m_i)}$ denotes the origin of $\mathit{m_i}$, 
  where 0 means $\mathit{m_i}$ is from a normal \textit{symbolic} state, and 1 
	means $\mathit{m_i}$ comes from a \textit{speculative} state.
\end{itemize*}
%
%
Then we can formalize $\mathit{\eta_{in}(m_i)}$ and $\mathit{\eta^\prime_{in}(m_i)}$ as follows. 
%
\begin{multline}
  \label{eqn:hc1}
    \mathit{\eta_{in}(m_i)}~:=~~ 
     \underbrace{ 
      \exists\mathit{j}\in[\mathit{0,i})|
      \wedge 
      \mathit{a_j}=\mathit{a_i} 
    ~\wedge~
      {\forall}x\in\left(j,i\right)\big|\mathit{a_x}\ne\mathit{a_i}
    }_{{\circled{1}}\mathit{~Find~the~nearest~identical~address~a_j}}
		~~~\wedge 
		\\
    ~~~~\sum_{{\scriptscriptstyle \mathit{y=j}+1}}^{{\scriptscriptstyle \mathit{i-}1}} 
    \underbrace{
      \mathit{cs(a_j)}=\mathit{cs(a_y)} 
      \wedge
      \nexists\mathit{z}\in(\mathit{j,y})|\mathit{tag(a_z)}=\mathit{tag(a_y)}
    }_{{\circled{2}}\mathit{~Count~the~unique~a_y~who~and~a_i~map~to~the~same~set}}
    <N
\end{multline}
\vspace{.2ex}
\begin{multline}
  \label{eqn:hc2}
    \mathit{\eta^\prime_{in}(m_i)}:=\mathit{\eta_{in}(m_i)}\wedge
    \underbrace{
      \mathit{org(a_j)}\ne1 
      \wedge
      \mathit{org(a_x)\ne}1 
      \wedge
      \mathit{org(a_y)\ne}1 
    }_{{\circled{3}}\mathit{~Filter~events~from~speculative~execution}}
\end{multline}
%
%

Given a $\mathit{m_i}$, we first search $\pi$ for an identical address 
$\mathit{a_j}$, which was visited in event $\mathit{m_j}$ happened before 
$\mathit{m_i}$. Also, $\mathit{a_j}$ has to be the nearest candidate that 
no other addresses between $\mathit{a_j}$ and $\mathit{a_i}$ are qualified
(cf. \circled{1}). Second, we count the unique addresses who and $\mathit{m_i}$
map to the same cache set and assure the number of such addresses is less 
than the set associativity N (cf. \circled{2}).
%
%Note that $\mathit{\eta_{in}(m_i)}$ is close to but not equivalent to 
%$\mathit{\mu_{in}(m_i)}$. 

Based on $\mathit{\eta_{in}(m_i)}$ we define $\mathit{\eta^\prime_{in}(m_i)}$
who has an extra constraint (cf. \circled{3}) upon $\mathit{\eta_{in}(m_i)}$. 
The new constraint ensures that all involved memory events must be from 
normal \textit{symbolic} states hence filtering the influences of memory 
events from \textit{speculative} states.

\subsubsection{New Divergent Behavior}
\label{sec:new_div}
It means executing $\mathit{m_i}$ under speculative execution with two different
inputs $\mathit{in}$ and $\mathit{in'}$ can cause a miss and a hit, respectively. 
E.g., reading \texttt{S[x]} exposes this symptom (cf. Section~\ref{sec:specu_leak}). 
To analyze the behavior, we build $\mathit{\mu_{in}(m_i)}$ which returns the cache
hit condition of $\mathit{m_i}$ in trace $\pi$:
%
%
\begin{multline}
  \label{eqn:hc}
    \mathit{\mu_{in}(m_i)}:=
    \bigvee_{{\scriptscriptstyle 0{\leq}j<i}}
    \Big(
    \underbrace{
      \mathit{tag(a_j)}=\mathit{tag(a_i)} 
			\wedge 
      \mathit{cs(a_j)}=\mathit{cs(a_i)} 
    }_{{\circled{4}}\mathit{~Identify~the~potential~a_j}}
    ~~~~~~\wedge 
		~~\\
    \underbrace{
      {\forall}x\in\left(j,i\right)\big |\mathit{tag(a_x)}\ne\mathit{tag(a_i)}
      \vee 
      \mathit{cs}(a_x)\ne\mathit{cs}(a_i)
    }_{{\circled{5}}\mathit{~Find~the~nearest~a_j}}
		~~~\wedge 
		\\
    \sum_{{\scriptscriptstyle \mathit{y=j}+1}}^{{\scriptscriptstyle \mathit{i-}1}} 
    %\Big(
    \underbrace{
      \mathit{cs(a_j)}=\mathit{cs(a_y)} 
      \wedge
      \nexists\mathit{z}\in(\mathit{j,y})|\mathit{tag(a_z)}=\mathit{tag(a_y)}
    }_{{\circled{6}}\mathit{~Count~the~unique~a_y~who~and~a_i~map~to~the~same~set}}
    <N 
    \Big)
\end{multline}
\vspace{.8ex}
%
%

Still, given a $\mathit{m_i}$, we first seek a prior $\mathit{m_j}$ 
from $\pi$ who might let $\mathit{m_i}$ cause a cache hit. That is, the 
addresses $\mathit{a_j}$ and $\mathit{a_i}$ have the same \emph{tag} 
and \emph{set} values (cf. \circled{4}). Moreover, we need to find the 
nearest $\mathit{m_j}$ since $\mathit{m_i}$'s cache behavior directly 
relies on it --- this demand is achieved by ensuring the non-existence 
of a $\mathit{m_x}$ between $\mathit{m_j}$ and $\mathit{m_i}$. And, 
$\mathit{m_x}$ and $\mathit{m_i}$ own the same \textit{tag} and 
\textit{set} values (cf. \circled{5}).


Next, we consider the cache replacement policy. \SpecuSym models the N-way 
set-associative cache with the LRU policy, whereas other policies can be 
modeled and embedded in equation~(\ref{eqn:hc}) as well. Intuitively, on 
finding a candidate $\mathit{m_j}$ for $\mathit{m_i}$, the executed events 
between $\mathit{m_j}$ and $\mathit{m_i}$ should not evict $\mathit{m_j}$ 
from the cache, to promise a cache hit for $\mathit{m_i}$. Under the LRU 
policy, we observe that if satisfying property~\ref{pro:p1}, can this 
non-evict requirement be met.
%
\begin{pro}
  \label{pro:p1}
  To avoid evicting the most recently used cache line from a cache set 
  \textsc{Set}, the total number of subsequent unqiue cache mappings to 
  \textsc{Set} must be less than the set associativity.
\end{pro}
%
Sub-formula \circled{6} checks whether an event $\mathit{m_y}$ between 
$\mathit{m_j}$ and $\mathit{m_i}$ can form a uniquely new mapping to the 
set that $\mathit{a_i}$ maps to. We perform the check by first comparing 
the \textit{set} values of $\mathit{a_y}$ and $\mathit{a_i}$. If the 
comparison satisfies, we further analyze if address $\mathit{a_y}$ has 
never been accessed by an event $\mathit{m_z}$ --- by confirming that the 
\emph{tag} values of $\mathit{a_z}$ and $\mathit{a_y}$ always differ. If 
this check also satisfies, then $\mathit{a_y}$ must form a uniquely new 
cache mapping. We count the new mappings and embed \textsc{Property}
\ref{pro:p1} in equation (\ref{eqn:hc}).


Take a 9-event trace $\pi$:=
\{$\mathit{m_1,m_2,\underline{m_1,m_3,m_3,m_4,m_5,m_4,m_1}}$\} as the 
example. For brevity, we assume all the memory addresses associate with 
the same cache set, and each address corresponds to one cache line. And, 
the cache set associativity is \textit{4}. The question is, whether the 
last event, $\mathit{m_1}$, can lead to a cache hit. Here we use 
\#$n$ to index these events where $n\in$[1,9].


Backtracking from the last event $\mathit{m_1}$, we first locate two prior 
$\mathit{m_1}$ events, \#1 and \#3, as the candidates that satisfy \circled{4}. 
Then, according to \circled{5}, we select the nearest event \#3, to form a 
sub-trace $\rho$ as underlined in $\pi$. Note that after $\rho$'s head event 
$\mathit{m_1}$, the cache line used by this $\mathit{m_1}$ becomes the most 
recently used line. Let's name the line as \emph{l}. Then, following \circled{6}, 
along $\rho$ we can identify \emph{3} uniquely new cache mappings, incurred by 
events \#4 ($\mathit{m_3}$), \#6 ($\mathit{m_4}$), and \#7 ($\mathit{m_5}$), 
respectively. Other events, i.e., \#5 ($\mathit{m_3}$) and \#8 ($\mathit{m_4}$),
cannot form unique mappings since they do not satisfy \circled{6}.


Therefore, we conclude that the target event, $\mathit{m_1}$, must lead to a 
cache hit because the identified \emph{3} unique cache mappings at most evict 
the other 3 lines rather than the line \emph{l}. In other words, the number of 
uniquely new mappings is less than the cache set associativity, which conforms 
to \textsc{Property}~\ref{pro:p1}.


\subsection{Cache Behavior Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

This section leverages the formal terms $\mathit{\mu_{in}(m_i)}$, 
$\mathit{\eta_{in}(m_i)}$ and $\mathit{\eta^\prime_{in}(m_i)}$ (cf. Section
\ref{sec:modeling}) to analyze the cache behavior of $\mathit{m_i}$. In general, 
if $\mathit{m_i}$ has no cache behavior variance in both speculative execution 
and non-speculative execution for any inputs, it has no leaks. Otherwise, at the 
program location of $\mathit{m_i}$, there is a leak. 


%\subsubsection{Leak Constraint Construction}
%\label{sec:leak_constraint}

In Algorithm~\ref{alg:specusym}, \SpecuSym invokes $\mathit{AnalyzeCache}$ right
before interpreting a memory event (line 13). In this procedure, \SpecuSym first 
examines whether the current state $s$ is a $\mathit{symbolic}$ state, and the 
event $s.e$ relates to sensitive input (line 30). It is because the timing effect 
inside speculative execution is externally invisible, and we are interested in the 
sensitive data relevant memory accesses. Next, \SpecuSym builds the leak constraint 
$\theta$ for event $s.e$ and solves for a solution (lines 31-33). If the solution
does not exist, \SpecuSym claims leakage-free at $s.e$ in current state $s$.

To form $\theta$, we need to build the constraint exposing new cache behaviors
at a given memory event $\mathit{m_i}$ as follows.
%
\begin{multline}
  \label{eqn:new_behav}
  ~~~~~~~
  \mathit{opp_i}:=~
  \forall\mathit{in,in'}.
  \big(
  \mathit{\eta_{in}(m_i)\neq\eta_{in'}^\prime(m_i)}
  \big)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\end{multline}
%
\begin{multline}
  \label{eqn:new_behav}
  ~~~~~~~
  \mathit{div_i}:=~
  \exists\mathit{in,in'}.
  \big(
  \mathit{in\neq in'\wedge\mu_{in}(m_i) \neq \mu_{in'}(m_i)}
  \big)
  ~~~~~~~
\end{multline}
%
%
\ignore{
%
\begin{multline}
  \label{eqn:leak}
  ~~
  \theta:=
  \Big(
  \mathit{div_i}
  \wedge
  \big(
  \sum_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathit{k=0}}^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathit{n}} 
  \mathit{\eta_{in''}(m_k)=}0
  \neq
  \sum_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathit{k=0}}^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathit{n}} 
  \mathit{\eta_{in''}(m_k)=}1
  \big)
  \Big)
  \vee 
  \mathit{opp_i}
  ~~
\end{multline}
%
}
%
\ignore{
Note that 
speculative execution not only evicts cache lines to cause new misses but also loads 
memory data into cache that benefits new hits. Since a leak refers to the noticeable 
timing variance in program runs with and without speculative execution, from 
$\mathit{opp_i}$ the amount of new misses should differ from the amount of new hits. 
And we construct the final leak constraint $\theta$ on this observation:
}
%
%
$\mathit{opp_i}$ checks the existence of \textit{New Opposite Behavior} and 
$\mathit{div_i}$ reasons \textit{New Divergent Behavior}, respectively. We 
define $\theta:=\mathit{opp_i}\vee\mathit{div_i}$ as the leak constraint at 
$\mathit{m_i}$. \SpecuSym first computes $\mathit{\eta_{in'}^\prime(m_i)}$ 
because of the lower cost of a \textit{must-be} solving. Then, it uses the 
concretized value to substitute $\mathit{\eta_{in'}^\prime(m_i)}$ in 
$\mathit{opp_i}$ for the further solving of $\mathit{in}$. If this targeted 
$\mathit{in}$ exists, then $opp_i$ must be satisfiable, and \SpecuSym can 
safely skip the rest analysis of $\mathit{div_i}$. Otherwise, it has to 
continue reasoning $\mathit{div_i}$. Finally, if the solver successfully 
returns a concrete solution of $\theta$, \SpecuSym generates a test case 
including two inputs, the trace $\pi$, and event $\mathit{m_i}$ as the leak 
witness.


For instance, in Figure~\ref{fig:3a}, before interpreting the \texttt{load} 
event of \texttt{S[x]}, \SpecuSym analyzes the cache since the sensitive 
data relevant address {\texttt{S[x]}} is from a \textit{symbolic} state 
$s$. At this point, trace $\pi$ in $s$ is {\small \{\texttt{S[0]},...,
\texttt{S[254]},\texttt{x},\texttt{v2},\texttt{v1},\texttt{S[x]}\}}. Also,
in non-speculative execution reading {\small\texttt{S[x]}} must get a cache 
hit (cf. Section~\ref{sec:no_leak}). 
Substituting $\mathit{\eta_{in'}^\prime(m_i)}$ with value 1 in $\mathit{opp_i}$, 
\SpecuSym tries to solve  \forall\mathit{in}.($\mathit{\eta_{in}(m_i)\neq}$1). 
Unfortunately, this simplified $\mathit{opp_i}$ is still unsatisfiable since 
$\mathit{\eta_{in}(m_i)}$ evaluates to 1 if $\mathit{in}$$\neq$0. Therefore, 
\SpecuSym moves forward to $\mathit{div_i}$. This time, it successfully returns 
two values 0 and 1, which expose a cache miss and a hit, respectively. Finally, 
\SpecuSym outputs the solved values, the trace $s.\pi$, and the \textit{read} 
event of {\texttt{S[x]}}.


It is worth noting that processors may mispredict branches several times 
along a program path. As a result, we need to count the cache side effects 
from multiple mispredictions. However, attackers always expect the minimum 
effort to trigger mispredictions for leak purposes. Meanwhile, manipulating 
multiple speculation windows is very difficult for external attackers. In 
\SpecuSym, we follow the attacker perspective to study whether one misprediction 
could be enough to cause timing leaks and leave the multiple speculation cases 
as our future work. 



\subsection{Optimizations}
\label{sec:optimize}

\subsubsection{Constraint Transformation.}
In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, constraints $\mathit{opp_i}$ and $\mathit{div_i}$
captures the complete set of leak-related cache behaviors. However, based on the
timing-leakage-free assumption of a target program under non-speculative execution,
we observe a property which helps \SpecuSym accelerate the cache analysis:
%
\begin{pro}
  \label{pro:p2}
  If under the same input $\mathit{in:=\{\lambda,t\}}$, the cache behaviors of a 
	$\lambda$-related	memory event $\mathit{m_i}$ in speculative execution and 
	non-speculative execution are opposite, there is a cache timing leak. 
\end{pro}
%
Property~\ref{pro:p2} reflects the intersection of $\mathit{opp_i}$ and 
$\mathit{div_i}$. As assumed, the cache behavior of $\mathit{m_i}$ in 
non-speculative execution is deterministic. In case an opposite behavior 
under speculative execution, $\mathit{m_i}$ would cause either new opposite 
behavior or new divergent behavior. In any case, it is a leak. Then the 
solving of $\theta$ turns to be reasoning the existence of such $\mathit{in}$, 
which has cheaper computation cost. We model the property into a new constraint 
$\theta'$:  
%
\begin{multline}
  \label{eqn:leak}
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  \theta':=
  \exists\mathit{in}.
  \mathit{
    \mu_{in}(m_i)~\neq~\eta_{in}^\prime(m_i)
  }
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\end{multline}
%
Due to the assumption mentioned above, $\mathit{\eta_{in}^\prime(m_i)}$ 
is always 1 (hit) or 0 (miss). Accordingly, if $\mathit{\mu_{in}(m_i)}$
(may-hit condition under speculation) evaluates to 0 or 1 on the same 
$\mathit{in}$, either $\mathit{opp_i}$ or $\mathit{div_i}$ may evaluate 
to 1, which already deduces a leak without solving $\mathit{opp_i}$ or 
$\mathit{div_i}$. Therefore, if $\theta'$ is satisfiable, $\theta$ also 
satisfies. 


\subsubsection{Formula Reduction.}
However, the size of $\theta'$ still intensely increases along with the 
increment of $i$, which pressures the constraint solver. By inspecting 
the constraint structure, we separate lengthy formulas into smaller pieces 
by following strategies. First, if a subformula of a Conjunctive Normal 
Form (CNF) formula evaluates as \textit{false}, we directly return \textit{false}. 
E.g., in equation (\ref{eqn:hc}), if \circled{4} is \textit{false}, we skip 
querying solver for \circled{5} and \circled{6}. Second, if a subformula 
in a Disjunction Normal Form (DNF) formula is determined as \textit{true}, 
we discard all other subformulas. As in equation (\ref{eqn:hc}), once we 
find the nearest $\mathit{a_j}$ by \circled{5}, we discard subformulas 
for indices before $j$. Third, if two subformulas are in negated forms, 
we avoid an extra solver query. E.g., in equation~\ref{eqn:hc}, constraint 
\circled{5} of $\mathit{m_j}$ is the negation of constraint \circled{4} 
of $\mathit{m}_{\mathit{j}+1}$, which implies we can save one constraint 
solving time. Fourth, since we repeatedly traverse memory access trace in 
constraint construction, caching the intermediate results avoids repeated 
computation. We bank the computed address-comparing formulas into a hash 
map so that \SpecuSym can quickly retrieve them with tolerable storage overhead. 



\subsubsection{Speculative Assumption Checking.}
Recall that in Algorithm~\ref{alg:specusym}, \SpecuSym duplicates a new state 
$s'$ from symbolic state $s$ (line 21) if the branch predicate closely relates 
to a memory value rather than a cache value. As mentioned earlier in Section
\ref{sec:modeling}, this strategy filters transient speculations that are unlikely 
to affect the cache. Wu et al.~\cite{WuW19} over-approximately treat all memory 
events as actual memory visits though predicate relevant values may have been 
loaded to the cache. \SpecuSym proposes an alternative for symbolic execution to 
deal with this issue. Ideally, to address the problem, we have to perform a 
burdensome cache analysis starting from the current branch to the first memory 
access, examining whether the value involved in the branch predicate is in cache 
or not. However, we also observe that the memory accesses from the current branch 
to the last branch typically have a critical influence on the cache state before 
current branch. Therefore, to balance the precision and efficiency, \SpecuSym 
backwardly examines the memory accesses in this range. If the predicate-related 
values have been fetched to cache beforehand and still exists in the cache, we 
regard the speculative modeling at this branch as unnecessary. Otherwise, we still 
conduct all modeling and analysis, as usual, to avoid missing leaks. Although this 
optimization introduces extra computation overhead, it still benefits overall 
performance since the targted cases commonly exist in programs because of the time 
and spatial locality purposes.


\ignore{
Besides, we also record 
instructions whose memory access has manifested leakage so that 
following analysis can directly skip these instructions and carries on. 
}

\ignore{
\textbf{Bound mis-prediction rate.}
Modern processor typically has a mis-prediction rate lower than 90\% 
\cite{} which means it's very uncommon that all prediction results are 
wrong. Therefore, we set up a bound of mis-prediction rate by selecting 
at most 10\% out of all speculative state trace for analysis. Only memory 
access in these traces will be considered while the others are ignored. 
Furthermore, instead of enumerating all combinations of selected traces, 
we only analyze part of them without losing accuracy according to following 
observation: using LRU policy, the nearer a memory access is, the more impact 
it has on cache state. Thus, we only analyze combinations of speculative 
state traces that share no common suffixes.
}

\ignore{
From implementation, we skip analyzing memory access that has already 
manifested leakage. Since we assume the target program is leakage-free 
under non-speculative execution, $\mathit{\eta_{in}^\prime(m_i)}$ must be 
0 (miss) or 1 (miss). Meanwhile, if $\mathit{\mu_{in}(m_i)}$ who denotes 
the may-hit condition has a different value to $\mathit{\eta_{in}^\prime(m_i)}$, 
then there must be a new cache behavior, either \textit{Divergent} or 
\textit{Opposite}. Thereby $\theta'$ conforms to $\theta$.

\sgnote{cf. Line 35 of Algorithm~\ref{alg:specusym}. We only build cache 
hit condition on nondeterministic addresses.}
\sgnote{instead of building a lengthy formula for equation~\ref{eqn:hc}, we 
conduct solving upon each preceding access individually. And, once reaching 
a must hit or must miss one, we directly skip it for speedup.} 
}


\section{Evaluations}
\label{sec:evaluation}


We have implemented \SpecuSym based on the KLEE~\cite{CadarDE08} symbolic 
executor and the LLVM compiler~\cite{LattnerA04}. We refit KLEE in three
main aspects. First, we made KLEE support the bounded execution of auxiliary 
\textit{speculative} state and schedule the parent \textit{symbolic} state 
afterward, to mimic the branch misprediction. Second, we made KLEE stitch 
a sequence of memory events from both normal \textit{symbolic} state and 
\textit{speculative} states, to represent the incorporation of cache data 
from speculation. Third, we made KLEE analyze the cache behaviors on memory 
events to generate concrete test cases for timing leaks. Based on these new 
components, we built \SpecuSym for the cache timing leak analysis under 
speculative execution.

Specifically, after loading the LLVM bit-code of the target program, \SpecuSym 
executes it symbolically, explores speculative states, records the memory 
event trace, and conducts cache analysis following Algorithm~\ref{alg:specusym}. 
The leak constraint is encoded in Z3-compatible form. On solving the constructed 
constraints, \SpecuSym outputs leak witness, including the event trace, the leaky 
memory operation location, and the solved inputs. 

We design the following research questions for the experiments: 
\begin{compactitem}
\item Can \SpecuSym successfully identify cache timing leaks introduced 
by speculative execution?
\item Can \SpecuSym complement the abstract interpretation based method 
by providing more accurate results?
\item Can the proposed optimizations boost the overall performance of \textsc{SpecuSym}?
\end{compactitem}

Table~\ref{tbl:benchs} shows the statistics of the benchmarks for evaluation.  
The first three columns, \textbf{Name}, \textbf{LoC}, and \textbf{Source}, 
indicate the names, the lines of code, and the sources of these benchmarks. 
Column \textbf{S-In} denotes the sensitive input size in bytes. The last 
column \textbf{Brs} shows the number of conditional branches in each program.


Our benchmark suite consists of a diverse set of open-source C programs. 
The first program comes from hpn-ssh~\cite{hpn-ssh}. The second group has 
five programs from LibTomCrypt 1.18.1~\cite{LibTomCrypt}. The third group 
uses two programs from glibc 2.29~\cite{glibc}. The fourth group includes 
three programs from the Tegra library~\cite{Tegra}. The rest benchmarks 
are from the Libgcrypt 1.8.4~\cite{Libgcrypt} and the Spectre vulnerability
application~\cite{spectre-attack}. Most benchmarks are computation-intensive 
despite the compact program volumes. The sensitive input of each benchmark 
is initialized to a symbol whose size shows in column \textbf{S-In}. Also, 
each program has 1 to 133 conditional branches.


We evaluate the benchmarks on the N-way set-associative cache and LRU 
policy with different cache settings. To be specific, we design four 
caches as (1) 32KB cache size with N=4; (2) 32KB cache size with N=8; (3) 
64KB cache size with N=8; and (4) 32KB cache size with N=512. Each cache 
line has 64 bytes for all caches. The first three settings are close to 
the L1 data cache classes in modern processors like~\cite{Skylake,Kabylake}. 
The last setting forms a fully-associative cache on which we compare 
\SpecuSym with \cite{WuW19}. Besides, we evaluate the effectiveness of 
optimizations using the third setting. All the evaluations are conducted 
on a machine running Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit Server Linux with Intel(R) Xeon(R) 
2.20GHz CPUs 24 cores and 256GB RAM. Each benchmark is allowed to run at 
most 12 hours.

In this section, we conduct experiments for the first research question. Table
\ref{tbl:detection} shows the leak detection results under the 3 set-associative 
cache settings. Let's name these caches as {$C_1$}, $C_2$, and $C_3$. $C_1$ has 
a 32KB size, and each cache set consists of 4 lines. As each line has 64 bytes, 
$C_1$ has 128 sets in total. $C_2$ also owns 32KB size, but its associativity 
increases to 8. Hence it has 64 sets. $C_3$ has 64KB size while its associativity 
remains 8, thereby it has 128 sets and 1024 cache lines. For each benchmark, we 
collect execution statistics under all 3 cache settings, including the total 
execution time in minute (Time (m)) and the amount of divergent/opposite leaks,
named \#.D/O. 


Overall, \SpecuSym identified that 6 out of 15 benchmarks suffer from timing 
leaks. Specifically, \texttt{blowfish} is leaky only under cache $C_2$ while 
the other 5 programs have leaks under all 3 caches. Among these 5 programs, 
\texttt{DES}~\cite{glibc} has both D/O leaks in all caches; \texttt{AES} has 
both D/O leaks in $C_1$, but only opposite leaks in $C_2$ and $C_3$; and the 
rest three programs (\texttt{chacha20}, \texttt{encoder}, and \texttt{DES}
\cite{OpenSSL111c}) have only opposite leaks under all the 3 caches.


Next, we compare the results under $C_1$ and $C_2$ to research how the cache 
associativity variation affects leak occurrence. Intuitively, the more lines 
per cache set, the less potential cache conflicts hence fewer leaks. However, 
experiments affirm that the increased associativity indeed triggers more leaks. 
First, \SpecuSym detected 60 and 130 leaks under $C_1$ and $C_2$, respectively; 
second, 5 out of the 6 leaky programs have more leaks under $C_2$. The only 
exception, \texttt{encoder}, has 5 leaks in both $C_1$ and $C_2$. Third, the 
non-leaky program under $C_1$, \texttt{blowfish}, now turns to expose 2 new 
leaks under $C_2$. This phenomenon is mostly because the speculative memory 
visits raise more cache hits --- the misses under non-speculative execution 
now have higher possibilities to be cache hits since speculative executio has
feteched memory data earlier into the cache. 


Further, we compare between $C_2$ and $C_3$, to research how the cache size 
could affect leak detection. We find that despite the large 32KB cache size 
difference, the detection results show no drastic variances. First, \SpecuSym
detected the same types and amounts of leaks in 3 programs (\texttt{chacha20}, 
\texttt{encoder}, and \texttt{DES}~\cite{OpenSSL111c}) in both $C_2$ and
$C_3$. The analysis time is also close. Second, another two leaky programs, 
\texttt{AES} and \texttt{DES}~\cite{glibc}, also exhibit similar statistics.
Third, the main difference comes from \texttt{blowfish}, which has two leaks 
on $C_2$ but no leaks on $C_3$. Though this unique case indicates that smaller 
cache might incur more leaks, it is not the majority situation. 


Besides, we also observe drastically varying results from different versions 
of the same algorithm. E.g., in three DES implementations from OpenSSL
\cite{OpenSSL111c}, glibc~\cite{glibc}, and Libgcrpt~\cite{Libgcrypt}, 
\SpecuSym detected only opposite leaks in OpenSSL \texttt{DES}, both D/O 
leaks in glibc \texttt{DES}, and no leaks in Libgcrypt \texttt{DES}. Meanwhile, 
OpenSSL \texttt{DES} needs about 11 minutes of analysis time upon all caches. 
The glibc \texttt{DES} uses 52 minutes for $C_1$ but around 6.5 hours on both 
$C_2$ and $C_3$. By contrast, Libgcrypt \texttt{DES} costs merely 1 minute under 
all 3 caches. 


Therefore, we can answer the first research question: \SpecuSym is capable of 
detecting timing leaks introduced by speculative execution. It also supports 
various caches for comparative analysis.

We compare \SpecuSym with \cite{WuW19} in Table~\ref{tbl:cmp}, to answer the 
second research question. Column 1 of Table~\ref{tbl:cmp} lists all the used
benchmarks in~\cite{WuW19} for timing leak evaluation. Columns 2-3 show the 
detection result and the computation time of this abstract interpretation 
based method~\cite{WuW19}. Columns 4-6 depict the result of \textsc{SpecuSym}, 
while column 5 lists the total amount of detected leaks. To ensure a fair 
comparison, we configure a 512-line fully-associative cache with LRU policy, 
which equals the cache setting used in~\cite{WuW19}. Let's name it as $C_4$.


Overall, \cite{WuW19} reported that 5 of the 10 benchmarks are leaky, as marked 
with \ding{52} in column 2. Consequently, the rest 5 programs are free of cache
timing leaks. For these non-leaky programs, \SpecuSym also detects no leaks, as 
shown in column 4. This means \SpecuSym introduces no false positives on analyzing 
these robust programs. In contrast, for those \ding{52} results from~\cite{WuW19}, 
\SpecuSym provides different results on two benchmarks \texttt{hash} and \texttt{ocb}, 
as underlined in Table~\ref{tbl:cmp}. They are deemed to be leaky in~\cite{WuW19},
while \SpecuSym found no leaks in them. We manually inspect the two benchmarks and 
confirm that \SpecuSym gives the right answer --- no leaks exist in the two programs. 
The inaccurate results of~\cite{WuW19} may root from its over-approximation nature,
and they are indeed false positives.


For the remaining programs, \texttt{chacha20}, \texttt{encoder}, and \texttt{DES}, 
both \SpecuSym and~\cite{WuW19} have detected leaks. However, \cite{WuW19} only 
claims the leaky results whereas \SpecuSym generates richer information than
\cite{WuW19}. E.g., \SpecuSym pinpoints 9, 5, and 8 leaky memory operations in 
these benchmarks, respectively. Moreover, \SpecuSym can provide inputs and memory 
event trace for leak diagnosis. Note that \SpecuSym generally performs faster on 
$C_4$ than on set-associative caches $C_1$, $C_2$, and $C_3$ since the extreme cache 
setting of $C_4$ advances cache utilization and cache hit rate in these benchmarks. 


One drawback of \SpecuSym is the computation overhead. Table~\ref{tbl:cmp} shows 
that the abstract interpretation based method~\cite{WuW19} finishes all benchmarks 
in 35 seconds, whereas \SpecuSym needs 725.7 seconds to analyze an OpenSSL {\ttt{DES}}. 
Worse, the analysis time under $C_3$ for the glibc \texttt{DES}~\cite{glibc} even 
rises to about 6.6 hours (cf. Table~\ref{tbl:detection}). The cost mainly comes from 
constraint solver since \SpecuSym reasons individual memory accesses on each program 
path. However, sacrificing the performance for the precision achieves reasonable 
paybacks. First, the increased overhead of most benchmarks is still tolerable. Next, 
\SpecuSym finds false positives from~\cite{WuW19} and generates precise inputs. Moreover, 
if~\cite{WuW19} provides assisting information, e.g., the suspicious locations on the 
control flow graph, \SpecuSym can guide its analysis to the problematic area earlier. 


Now, we answer the second research question: \SpecuSym can complement the abstract 
interpretation based analysis on false positive elimination and leak witness generation.

This section studies the performance of the optimization strategies 
proposed in Section~\ref{sec:optimize}. Table~\ref{tbl:opt} compares 
the overall performance between the \texttt{Baseline} \SpecuSym with
no optimizations, and the \texttt{Optimized} \SpecuSym version with 
all optimizations enabled, as listed in column 1. The second and the 
third columns compare the execution time and the size of involved 
constraints. The fourth column and the last column disclose the 
identified new divergent leaks and new opposite leaks, respectively. 
The used cache setting for this experiment is $C_3$.


As shown in column 2, after optimizations, the analysis time of the 
\texttt{Optimized} \SpecuSym significantly decreases, falling to only 
$30.7\%$ of the \texttt{Baseline} \textsc{SpecuSym} execution time, 
which proves the effectiveness of the optimizations in accelerating 
the analysis. 


Apart from the time drop, the \texttt{Optimized} \SpecuSym reduces
the size of the involved constraint by more than $20\%$, compared 
to the \texttt{Baseline} version, as shown in column 3. Though the 
constraint size reduction looks not as impressive as the time reduction, 
the proposed strategies greatly ease the solver burden by constraint 
transformation and formula reduction. Undoubtedly, constraint optimization 
is the primary reason for the time decrease.


Moreover, column 4 and column 5 disclose that the \texttt{Optimized} 
\SpecuSym detects 31.8\% more leaks in total than the \texttt{Baseline} 
version, in a 12-hour threshold. This result highlights the utmost 
importance of optimizations because it energizes \SpecuSym to detect more 
leaks within a given resource budget. 


We also examine how the optimizations impact each benchmark in terms of 
the analysis time in Figure~\ref{fig:4a} and the constraint size in Figure
\ref{fig:4b}. Programs in these two figures are arranged using their orders 
in Table~\ref{tbl:benchs}. Tags \texttt{Base} and \texttt{Opt} stand for the 
\SpecuSym versions without and with optimizations, respectively. 


Clearly, Figure~\ref{fig:4a} shows that optimizations drastically reduce 
time cost for $6$ out of $15$ cases from hundreds of minutes to less than 
an hour. On the one hand, \texttt{Base} has more redundant computations 
while \texttt{Opt} reuses cached intermediate results. On the other hand, 
formula reduction lowers the cost of solving. Figure~\ref{fig:4b} shows 
how optimizations reduce the constraint size where AES~\cite{LibTomCrypt}, 
glibc DES~\cite{glibc}, and seed~\cite{Tegra} have significant improvements. 
For the other cases, the memory trace length is typically short. Thus, our 
optimizations have no apparent impacts upon them.


Finally, we answer the last research question: our optimizations significantly 
boost the overall performance by saving 69.3\% execution time and detecting 
31.8\% more timing leaks.



\subsection{Threat to Validity}
\label{sec:threat}

\SpecuSym works on the LLVM IR. However, the program runtime behavior might 
differ due to compiler backend optimization and address space layout 
randomization (ASLR). More low-level details can further facilitate \SpecuSym 
to improve the analysis.


\SpecuSym considers nested speculative execution because branch instruction 
may also exist in speculation. As the speculative window is usually short, 
we treat the nested depth as configurable and set it to 2 in evaluation. 
However, experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this under-approximation 
approach.
	

So far, \SpecuSym cannot support the analysis of multithreaded programs. Though 
{\sc{SymSC}}~\cite{GuoWW18} leveraged multithreading for timing leak detection, 
considering thread concurrency and speculative execution together greatly amplifies 
the state space and interleaving space, which pose exceptional challenges for a 
precise analysis.


Another threat is from the out-of-order execution, which schedules a set of 
data-independent instructions in an out-of-order manner, rather than sticking 
to the program order. This processor optimization may affect the accuracy of 
our analysis. However, incorporating both speculative execution and out-of-order 
execution requires more dedicated analysis. We leave it as future work. 


\ignore{
We do not consider the situation that speculative execution leverages Branch 
Target Buffer (BTB) or Return Stack Buffer (RSB) to select the destinations 
of indirect branches. Such vulnerabilities have been effectively mitigated 
by Intel and AMD through Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier (IBPB) settings.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

Regarding the security impact of processor speculative execution
\cite{kimuraKT1996}, Kocher et al.~\cite{KocherGGHHLMPSY19} demonstrated 
that speculative execution influences the cache state, thus leading to 
cache timing attacks, which motivates the design of \textsc{SpecuSym}. 


Symbolic execution~\cite{King76} has been applying to side-channel analysis 
because of the inherent natures of precise reasoning and input generation. 
To quantify the information leakage through a timing side-channel, 
Chattopadhyay et al.~\cite{ChattopadhyayBRZ17,Chattopadhyay17} and Basu et al.
\cite{BasuC17} developed symbolic execution methods to study dependencies 
between sensitive data and cache behaviors. Wang et al. developed CacheD
\cite{WangWLZW17}, which targets timing leaks through a trace-based symbolic 
execution. Furthermore, Brotzman et al.~\cite{BrotzmanLZTK2018} proposed 
CaSym, a symbolic reasoning method that supports cache analysis over multiple 
program paths. Considering the cache effects from thread interleavings, Guo
et al.~\cite{GuoWW18} proposed \textsc{SymSC} to analyze cache timing leaks 
due to multithreading. These methods, however, are all unaware of cache state 
changes due to speculative execution.  


Abstract interpretation~\cite{CousotC77} has also been adopting to cache 
reasoning in terms of its scalable analysis and sound approximation. 
To estimate cache side channels, CacheAudit~\cite{DoychevFKMR13}
approximates cache states by concrete state abstraction. Based on CacheAudit, 
Barthe et al.~\cite{BartheKMO14} track the program cache state affected by
the attacker from a separate process. CacheS~\cite{WangBLWZW19} provides a 
secret-augmented abstract domain to track program secrets and dependencies. 
However, CacheAudit and CacheS are unaware of the impact of speculative 
execution. Though Wu et al.~\cite{WuW19} developed a dedicated abstract 
interpretation method for cache timing leak analysis under speculative 
execution, the technique is incapable of generating precise inputs to 
diagnose leaks in depth. 


\ignore{
It treats public data in a coarse-grained 
fashion and secret data in a finer-grained manner to balance the scalability 
and precision.
}


Likewise, grey-box fuzz testing has been used in detecting Spectre-type
\cite{KocherGGHHLMPSY19} program vulnerabilities~\cite{OleksenkoTSF19}, 
exposing side channels~\cite{NilizadehNP19}, and revealing timing leaks
\cite{HeEC19}. However, these methods are either unaware of speculative 
execution~\cite{NilizadehNP19,HeEC19} or relying on costly instrumentations 
on the control flow. Also, due to the testing nature, these methods primarily 
count on the fuzz heuristics while \SpecuSym systematically solves for precise 
inputs.


Besides the above analysis methods, there also exists compiler assisted techniques 
that remove or model timing leaks. Doychev et al.~\cite{DoychevK17} studied 
that compiler optimization can remove cache side channels.  Sung et al.
\cite{SungPW18} developed a compiler frontend transformation that models cache
timing behaviors for verification purposes. Still, none of them considers
speculative execution.


Among the existing works, KLEESPECTRE~\cite{WangCBMR19}, Spectector
\cite{GuarnieriKMRS19}, and~\cite{ZhangCW12} are closely related to 
\textsc{SpecuSym}. KLEESPECTRE~\cite{WangCBMR19} has a similar 
understanding of modeling speculation in symbolic execution. However, 
KLEESPECTRE~\cite{WangCBMR19} aims at Spectre-style vulnerability; 
thus, it has a crucial difference in constraint semantics. Spectector 
\cite{WangCBMR19} also targets Spectre vulnerability. It employs 
symbolic execution to prove speculative non-interference property or 
detect violations. Speculative symbolic execution~\cite{ZhangCW12} 
proposed a method to lazily reason branch feasibility until reaching 
a threshold, which improves the efficiency of the symbolic execution 
technique.


To conclude, existing works may fail to generate inputs, ignore cache 
affects from speculative execution, and model speculation for different 
purposes. In contrast, \SpecuSym models speculative execution through 
stateful symbolic execution to produce precise inputs that can study 
the cache timing side-channel leak in depth. 


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}


In this paper, we have presented a symbolic execution based method 
\SpecuSym for detecting cache timing leaks on running a sensitive data 
related program under speculative execution. \SpecuSym systematically 
explores the program state space and models speculative execution at 
conditional branches. By cache state modeling as well as cache behavior 
analysis, \SpecuSym leverages constraint-solving to search for divergent 
and opposite cache behaviors at memory access events. Experimental results
show that \SpecuSym can detect timing leaks under different cache settings.
The proposed optimizations help \SpecuSym save 69.3\% execution time to 
detect 31.8\% more leaks. Comparison between \SpecuSym and state-of-the-art 
abstract interpretation based method~\cite{WuW19} shows that \SpecuSym not 
only successfully detects leaks in the reported programs but also eliminates 
false positives for a more precise result.
